Hello.

this is a very simple listview based on ncurses. i created this because there 
was no brief tutorial on such subject and i wanted to give it a try ;)

feel free to use it anyway you like.

You can see how it works by compiling demo.cc

just remember: first compile files and then link them:

g++ <file.cc> -o <file.o>
g++ *.o -o demo -lncurses
